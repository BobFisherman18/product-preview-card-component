## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

I learned how to use Bootstrap for the first time! It makes styling sheets much easier. I learned how classes function in Bootstrap and what containers to use, how the grid system works, and what classes to use for the button. I was able to figure out how to remove the margins between my two columns since Bootstrap automatically calculates the margins. Bootstrap calls it gutters.

```html
<div class="row g-0">
```
```css
 .price {
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        position: relative;
        top: 80px;
    }
```
### Continued development

I will continue to use Bootstrap. 

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This what helped me learn HTML and CSS.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) - This Youtuber also helped me learn HTML and CSS. In addition, I watched a lot of Youtube videos about HTML and CSS. Youtube is your best friend in learning web development!
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) Always read the documentation!
